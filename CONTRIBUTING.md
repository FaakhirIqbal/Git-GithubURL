# Contributing to Git-Github URL Project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [LICENSE](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/FaakhirIqbal/Git-GithubURL/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/FaakhirIqbal/Git-GithubURL/issues/new); it's that easy!

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

### Example 1: Naming Conventions
Java Naming Conventions
Class Names: Class names should always be in UpperCamelCase. For example, MyExampleClass.
Method Names: Method names should always be in lowerCamelCase. For example, myExampleMethod.
Constants: Constants should be in ALL_UPPERCASE with words separated by underscores. For example, MY_CONSTANT_VALUE.

### Example 2: Comment Style
Inline and Block Comments
Inline Comments: Use inline comments sparingly and only for complex parts of the code. Place them above the line they are commenting on and start with //. For example:
```bash
// Calculate the user's age based on birth year
int age = currentYear - birthYear;

```
Block Comments: Use block comments for function descriptions and multi-line explanations. Start with /* and end with */. For example:
```bash
/*
 * This function calculates and returns the user's age.
 * It takes the current year and birth year as inputs.
 */
public int calculateAge(int currentYear, int birthYear) {
    return currentYear - birthYear;
}
